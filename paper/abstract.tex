This paper presents a research of a public dataset \dbName{} from \dbSource{} containing \dbTotalInstances{} instances with goals to forecast a trend and to explore an impact on population of USA\@.

To determine research results statistical approach was applied which consists of methods such as attribute selection, aggregation, pattern recognition, feature classification, multiple regression models, k-means clustering and visualization.

To improve and to cross-validate accuracy of research results linear and isotonic regression models were used.

To determine deviations of inflated states data have been grouped and classified by mean feature.

Goals of visualization part of research are to identify US states based on density rates and to build cluster using k-means algorithm.
